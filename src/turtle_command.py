class CommandString():
	''' A command string describing the movement pattern of a turtle.

	Consists of an initial movement pattern - where each character indicates
	a single movement - and a series of rules by which the movement pattern
	evolves over time.

	There are four possible commands for a turtle:
		'F': move forward one step whilst drawing a line
		'f': move forward one step without drawing a line
		'+': turn one angle increment left
		'-': turn one angle increment right

			initiator: the initial command string
			production: the rules by which to generate subsequent command strings.
				Should be a dictionary with entires in the form `prev : replacement` where `prev`
				is a single character. Whenever a subsequent command string is generated each
				instance of `prev` is replaced with it's corresponding `replacement`.
				Productions are applied in parallel, and it is assumed that each `prev` in
				the set of productions is unique (i.e., that productions are mutually
				exclusive).

			angle_inc: the amount - in degrees - by which to turn when directed to do so
